# Toise

Architecture review for Claude-maintained software.

**Core thesis:** Software maintained by Claude has different architectural needs than software maintained only by humans. These needs are empirically discoverable — codebases that were rebuilt for "claude-comfort" show consistent patterns. This skill codifies those patterns as review checks.

Grounded in Basecamp's *Getting Real* philosophy (less mass, interface first, opinionated software, fix time flex scope) and extended with **claude-maintainability** principles derived from real rebuild case studies.

See `references/claude-maintainability.md` for the full principles with evidence.
See `references/evidence.md` for the empirical case studies.

## When to Use

- Reviewing architecture of a codebase Claude will maintain long-term
- Inheriting an unfamiliar repo — assess before modifying
- Before adding significant complexity (new framework, new abstraction layer, new dependency)
- Periodic health check on an actively-developed project
- After a major refactor, to verify improvements landed

## When NOT to Use

- Pure code review (bugs, style, idiom) — use titans
- One-off scripts that won't be maintained
- Reviewing someone else's library you consume but don't modify

## The Eight Checks

Run all eight. Report each as a letter grade (A-F) with a one-line verdict and supporting evidence. Present as a table first, then expand failing checks.

### 1. Mass

**Question:** How much does this codebase weigh?

**Check:**
- Count runtime dependencies (package.json `dependencies`, pyproject.toml `[dependencies]`)
- Count build pipeline stages (bundler, transpiler, minifier, CSS preprocessor)
- Measure framework lock-in depth (can you swap the framework without rewriting?)
- Check for dead dependencies (imported but unused)

**Grading:**
- **A:** 0-3 runtime deps, no build step or single-command build
- **B:** 4-8 runtime deps, straightforward build
- **C:** 9-15 runtime deps, multi-stage build
- **D:** 16+ runtime deps or build pipeline with 3+ stages
- **F:** Can't build without reading a wiki

**Evidence:** Gueridon: 2 runtime deps, no build step (A). mise-en-space: 11 runtime deps, no build step (B). mcp-google-workspace v1 had 17 tools mapping 1:1 to APIs — mass in interface rather than dependencies.

### 2. State Clarity

**Question:** Can you point to where the application state lives?

**Check:**
- Is there an explicit state machine or state container? Where?
- Grep for global mutable state (`global`, `window.`, class-level mutation, singletons)
- Are there multiple components that independently track the same state? (Shadow state machines)
- Can a single component answer "what state is the system in right now?"

**Grading:**
- **A:** Single explicit state authority, consumers are pure renderers
- **B:** Explicit state, but some consumers derive local state
- **C:** State distributed across 2-3 locations with sync logic
- **D:** Implicit state inferred from flag combinations across files
- **F:** "It depends on timing" — state is a race condition

**Evidence:** claude-go had 5 systems implicitly encoding session state (F). Gueridon v2's StateBuilder is the single authority (A). The interim shadow state machine ("two state machines trying to agree on reality") was a C that degraded to D under edge cases.

### 3. Epicenter

**Question:** For each major screen/endpoint/command — is the core purpose immediately obvious?

**Check:**
- Read entry points (HTML files, route handlers, CLI commands). Is the primary content/function the structural root, or buried under chrome/middleware/abstraction?
- Can you identify what the module DOES from its first 20 lines?
- Are module names descriptive of purpose? (`state-builder.ts` vs `utils.ts`, `extractors/slides.py` vs `helpers.py`)

**Grading:**
- **A:** Every module's purpose is obvious from name + first 20 lines
- **B:** Most modules are clear; 1-2 need reading further
- **C:** Module purposes clear but buried under framework boilerplate
- **D:** Need to read 100+ lines to understand what a module does
- **F:** Modules named `utils`, `helpers`, `common`, `misc`

### 4. Opinion

**Question:** Does this software take a clear position, or try to be everything?

**Check:**
- Count preference/settings/configuration screens or options
- Count feature flags or A/B test branches
- Is there a stated vision ("project management is communication", "3 verbs not 17 tools")?
- Does the CLAUDE.md or README state what this software deliberately does NOT do?

**Grading:**
- **A:** Clear vision stated, deliberate exclusions documented, zero preference screens
- **B:** Vision clear, few configuration options, all justified
- **C:** Some unnecessary configurability, but core is opinionated
- **D:** Extensive preference screens, no clear position
- **F:** Tries to please everyone, feature flags everywhere

**Evidence:** Gueridon: no model picker, no thinking selector, no auth config — deliberate exclusions documented in decisions.md (A). mise: 3 verbs instead of 17 tools (A).

### 5. Three States

**Question:** Does every user-facing screen/endpoint handle regular, empty, and error conditions?

**Check:**
- For each screen/page/endpoint: grep for empty-state handling, error boundaries, loading states
- Check what happens with zero data (blank slate)
- Check what happens when the backend is unreachable
- Check what happens with malformed input

**Grading:**
- **A:** All screens handle all three states with thoughtful UX/messages
- **B:** Most screens handle all three; minor gaps
- **C:** Regular state polished, empty/error states minimal
- **D:** Error states are raw exceptions or generic "something went wrong"
- **F:** Empty state shows broken layout; errors crash

**Evidence:** Gueridon has a fourth state (reconnecting) because mobile demands it. mise has typed `MiseError` with `ErrorKind` enum and `retryable` hint.

### 6. Copywriting

**Question:** Are user-facing strings written with care?

**Check:**
- Extract button labels, placeholder text, error messages, empty state text
- Flag generic strings: "Submit", "Error", "Loading...", "Something went wrong", "N/A"
- Check whether error messages tell the user what to DO, not just what went wrong
- Check whether empty states explain what will appear and how to get started

**Grading:**
- **A:** Every string is purposeful, errors suggest actions, empty states guide
- **B:** Mostly good, a few generic strings
- **C:** Functional but generic ("Error occurred", "No data")
- **D:** Raw technical messages shown to users
- **F:** `console.log` or stack traces visible to end users

### 7. Cost of Change

**Question:** How expensive is it to change this software?

**Check:**
- Measure build time (if any)
- Measure test suite time
- Count files that must change for a typical feature addition
- Is there a build step between edit and seeing the result?
- How many files would a Claude need to read to add a new feature?

**Grading:**
- **A:** Edit-and-reload, tests < 15s, typical change touches 1-3 files
- **B:** Fast build (< 30s), tests < 60s, typical change touches 3-5 files
- **C:** Build under 2 minutes, tests under 5 minutes
- **D:** Build over 2 minutes or tests over 5 minutes
- **F:** "Deploy to see if it works"

**Evidence:** Gueridon: no build step, 576 tests in ~8s, typical change touches 1-2 files (A). mise: no build step, fixture-driven tests, adding a content type follows a 3-file recipe (A).

### 8. Claude-Readiness

**Question:** Is this codebase set up for a Claude to maintain it effectively?

**Check:**
- **CLAUDE.md quality:** Does it exist? Does it have architecture overview, module map, dependency rules, extension recipes, anti-patterns? Score 0-5 (one point each).
- **Test coverage as spec:** Can Claude understand what the code does by reading tests? Are there fixture files for complex inputs?
- **File size distribution:** What percentage of source files are under 500 lines? Under 800?
- **Pure function ratio:** What fraction of core logic is in pure, testable functions vs I/O-entangled code?
- **Framework magic depth:** How many layers of framework convention must Claude understand to trace a request end-to-end?
- **Decisions documented:** Is there a decisions.md or ADR directory with rationale?
- **Extension recipes:** Are "How to Add X" patterns documented?

**Grading:**
- **A:** CLAUDE.md 5/5, >80% files under 800 lines, core logic is pure functions, decisions documented, extension recipes present
- **B:** CLAUDE.md 3-4/5, >60% files under 800 lines, most core logic testable
- **C:** CLAUDE.md exists but thin, mixed file sizes, some pure functions
- **D:** No CLAUDE.md, large files, logic entangled with I/O
- **F:** No documentation, no tests, framework-dependent throughout

## Running the Review

### Phase 1: Measure (automated)

Use grep, glob, read, and bash to gather metrics for all eight checks. Do this systematically — don't skip to opinions.

```
# Mass
- Read package.json/pyproject.toml for dep counts
- Check for build scripts/config (webpack, vite, esbuild, tsc)
- Grep for unused imports

# State Clarity
- Grep for state management patterns (global, singleton, useState, this.state)
- Look for explicit state machine files
- Check if multiple files track overlapping state

# Epicenter
- Read entry points (index.html, main.py, server.ts, cli.py)
- Check module naming conventions
- Read first 20 lines of each source file

# Opinion
- Grep for preference/settings/config UI
- Count feature flags
- Read README/CLAUDE.md for stated vision and exclusions

# Three States
- Grep for error boundary/handler patterns
- Grep for empty state/blank slate/no-data handling
- Check error message quality

# Copywriting
- Extract user-facing strings (button text, placeholders, error messages)
- Flag generics

# Cost of Change
- Check build config complexity
- Run test suite, measure time
- Count files touched in last 10 feature commits

# Claude-Readiness
- Score CLAUDE.md against 5-point rubric
- Measure file size distribution
- Identify pure vs I/O-entangled modules
- Check for decisions.md and extension recipes
```

### Phase 2: Grade

Assign letter grades using the rubrics above. Be honest — the point is to find improvement opportunities, not to validate.

### Phase 3: Report

Present as:

```
## Getting Real Review: [project name]

| Check | Grade | Verdict |
|-------|-------|---------|
| Mass | B | 7 deps, no build step — lean but could trim 2 unused |
| State Clarity | A | StateBuilder is single authority |
| Epicenter | A | Every module named for purpose |
| Opinion | A | Vision stated, deliberate exclusions documented |
| Three States | B | Missing error state on settings page |
| Copywriting | C | 4 generic error messages, empty states need work |
| Cost of Change | A | Edit-and-reload, 8s test suite |
| Claude-Readiness | A | CLAUDE.md 5/5, extension recipes, decisions documented |

### Priority improvements
1. [Most impactful failing check — what to do]
2. [Second most impactful]
3. [Third, if any]
```

Only expand checks that score C or below. A and B grades get the one-line verdict only.

## Composing With Other Skills

| Skill | Relationship |
|-------|-------------|
| **titans** | Titans reviews code quality (bugs, craft, foresight). Getting Real reviews architecture and product decisions. Run both before shipping substantial work. |
| **bon** | Improvement items from the review become bon outcomes. |
| **mcp-builder** | When reviewing an MCP server, Getting Real's "Few verbs, small interface" check is particularly relevant. |

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-pattern | What happens |
|---|---|
| Skipping measurement | Opinions without evidence. Run phase 1 first. |
| Grading everything A | Sycophantic review helps nobody. The point is finding improvements. |
| Reviewing code style | That's titans' job. Getting Real reviews architecture decisions. |
| Proposing rewrites | The review identifies issues. Whether to rewrite is the user's call. |
| Ignoring Claude-Readiness | The eighth check is the novel contribution. Don't skip it. |

# trousse — Project Context

Trousse is a **skill drawer** for Claude Code — 17 SKILL.md files that teach Claude specialized workflows (code review, diagramming, file organization, etc.).

It does NOT own session lifecycle hooks or scripts. Those belong to [bon](https://github.com/spm1001/bon), which owns the full session protocol (hooks, handoffs, briefings, tactical tracking).

## Compatibility

**Tested with Claude Code:** 2.1.x
**Minimum required:** 2.0 (plugins API)

## Installation

Two paths:

| Path | Command | Skill names |
|------|---------|-------------|
| **Plugin** (recommended) | `/plugin` → batterie-de-savoir → trousse | `/trousse:diagram` |
| **Manual** | `git clone` + `./install.sh` | `/diagram` |

The plugin system discovers skills from `skills/*/SKILL.md` — no hooks, no settings.json registration needed.

## Skill Architecture

### Types

| Type | Trigger | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| User-invocable | Slash command | `/diagram`, `/titans` |
| Alias | Slash command → delegates | `/review` → titans |

### Conventions

- Description ends with `(user)` tag for user-facing skills
- `user-invocable: false` for skills loaded programmatically (companion skills)
- Reference files live in `references/` subdirectory, linked from main SKILL.md

### Current Skills (17)

amp-close, claude-survey, diagram, filing, github-cleanup, google-devdocs, ia-presenter, mandoline, neutral-claude, picture, review, screenshot, server-checkup, skill-forge, sprite, titans, toise

### Titans Review

`/titans` (or `/review`) dispatches three parallel Opus reviewers:

| Titan | Lens |
|-------|------|
| **Epimetheus** | Hindsight — bugs, debt, fragility |
| **Metis** | Craft — clarity, idiom, structure |
| **Prometheus** | Foresight — vision, extensibility |

Uses `Task` tool with `subagent_type: "explore-opus"`. Worth it for substantial work; overkill for quick fixes.

## Extending trousse

### Adding a New Skill

1. Create `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` with frontmatter
2. Add `skills/<name>/README.md` (optional but recommended)
3. Plugin auto-discovers from `skills/*/` — no hardcoded list

### Reference Files

Skills can have a `references/` subdirectory:
- Read as-needed, not loaded automatically
- Linked from main SKILL.md with "When to read" guidance
- Naming: UPPERCASE for major references, lowercase for specific topics

## Testing

### Mechanical (pytest)

```bash
uv run pytest           # All tests
uv run pytest -x        # Stop on first failure
uv run pytest -k close  # Single skill
```

Tests check:
- CSO linter pass + score >= 95/100
- Referenced files exist
- Scripts executable with shebang
- Anti-patterns table format consistency

### Semantic (titans)

For "does this skill actually make sense?" — use `/titans`. Three Opus reviewers catch issues the linter can't see (stale references, semantic contradictions, missing error handling).
